Dice Game Design on DE1-SoC Board
Project Overview
This project involves designing a dice game using VHDL or Verilog and implementing it on a DE1-SoC development board. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with RTL (Register Transfer Level) design, building input/output interfaces, and tackling system-level integration and optimization challenges.

Learning Objectives

Gain proficiency in designing digital systems with RTL descriptions.
Develop skills in creating and interfacing input/output peripherals.
Learn to approach system-level integration with a focus on optimization.
Acquire a solid understanding of the digital hardware development process.
Features
A fully functional dice game designed in VHDL or Verilog.
Implementation on the DE1-SoC board, utilizing its onboard features.
Modular design to facilitate ease of testing, debugging, and enhancement.
